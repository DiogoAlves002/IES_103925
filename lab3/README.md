# Notes taken while completing this lab


## Spring boot

easier way to run an application
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`


## Jakarta Persistence API *JPA*

Persistence means any mechanism by which Java objects outlive the application process that created them.
The JPA specification allows to define which objects should be persisted, and how they are persisted.
By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that guide implementers.


## Object-Relational Mapping *ORM*

ORM is a middleware application or tool that sits between the web application and database. 
Its a technique for converting data between Java objects and relational databases (table). 
In simple words, we can say that itimplements responsibility of mapping the object to relational model and vice-versa.
